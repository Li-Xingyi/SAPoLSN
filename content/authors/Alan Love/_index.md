Alan Love's research focuses on conceptual issues that arise in different areas of biological science. Much of his work has concentrated on the concepts of evolutionary innovation and novelty, which have been central to the research agenda articulated by many biologists in evolutionary developmental biology (Evo-devo). He is also interested in issues related to developmental biology and functional morphology. Using a combination of approaches, he investigates a variety of philosophical questions, including conceptual change, explanatory pluralism, the structure of evolutionary theory, reductionism, the nature of historical science, and interdisciplinary epistemology. Another area of his interest concerns methodological questions, such as the role of history in philosophical research and the nature of intuitions generated by thought experiments in philosophical inquiry.
