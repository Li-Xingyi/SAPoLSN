Emeritus Professor Paul Griffiths was formerly Challis Professor of Philosophy at the University of Sydney. He is a Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the Royal Society of NSW, and was awarded the RSNSW Medal for History and Philosophy of Science in 2019. 

He has been both a Laureate Fellow (2018) and a Federation Fellow (2007) of the Australian Research Council, each at the time the highest level of award available to an individual researcher in Australia.

Trained in philosophy of science at University of Cambridge and Australian National University, he specializes in assembling multi-disciplinary teams of philosophers and STEM researchers to address conceptual and theoretical questions in the life sciences. He played a substantial role in the establishment of the Charles Perkins Centre, the first and largest of Sydneyâ€™s multi-disciplinary institutes (MDIs) and was a member of its Executive from 2012-23.
