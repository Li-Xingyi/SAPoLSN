After working as a legal practitioner for several years, I decided to pursue philosophy for my interest in philosophical significance. I earned a master of arts degree in philosophy from University of Missouri-St. Louis, and received a doctorate from University of Missouri-Columbia on the topic of decision theory and causal reasoning. Before working full-time as an assistant professor at the Institute of Philosophy, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIP) in Beijing, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Fudan University in Shanghai, where I began my exploration of the philosophy of causality and causal modeling.
